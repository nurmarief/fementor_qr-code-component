In this challenge, I mainly learned about BEM Architecture for CSS, module bundling using webpack, and SASS.

About BEM Architecture priciples for CSS, I continue to learn:

3. split style files into blocks or components,
4. organizing style files by blocks,

About webpack 5 I learn:

2. using loader: html-loader, style-loader, css-loader, sass-loader,
3. plugins: mini-css-extract-plugin, html-webpack-plugin, css-minimizer-plugin, webpack-dev-server

About SASS I learn:

1. SASS variables, SASS map
